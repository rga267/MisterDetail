# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Purpose

This project is a single page web application. It was containerized using Dockerfile and deployed on IBM Cloud Kubernetes. The source code is mainly react and bootstrapped with reactstrap.

It contains a Home page for Mister Detail car detailing services with their services provided and their information.

It is still under development so some buttons or pages do not do anything at the moment.
